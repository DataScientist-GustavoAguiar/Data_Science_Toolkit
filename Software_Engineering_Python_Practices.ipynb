I’ve found fewer that talk about what to look for in a review and how to discuss code under review."

        "\n",
        "* Can I understand the code easily?\n",
        "* Does it use meaningful names and whitespace?\n",
        "* Is there duplicated code?\n",

        "Now that we know what we're looking for, let's go over some tips on how to actually write your code review. When your coworker finishes up some code that they want to merge to the team's code base, they might send it to you for review. You provide feedback and suggestions, and then they may make changes and send it back to you. When you are happy with the code, you approve it and it gets merged to the team's code base.\n",

        "As you may have noticed, with code reviews you are now dealing with people, not just computers. So it's important to be thoughtful of their ideas and efforts. You are in a team and there will be differences in preferences. The goal of code review isn't to make all code follow your personal preferences, but to ensure it meets a standard of quality for the whole team.\n",

        "\n",
        "This isn't really a tip for code review, but it can save you lots of time in a code review. Using a Python code linter like pylint can automatically check for coding standards and PEP 8 guidelines for you. It's also a good idea to agree on a style guide as a team to handle disagreements on code style, whether that's an existing style guide or one you create together incrementally as a team."

They will be much more receptive to your feedback if they understand your thought process and are accepting recommendations, rather than following commands. They also may have done it a certain way intentionally, and framing it as a suggestion promotes a constructive discussion, rather than opposition."
